# üëç Verified Clan

## What is it?

<mark style="color:red;">Verified clan</mark> is a clan, which provides more features for its members.&#x20;

In most cases, when someone creates a clan, it's enough to have only _basic_ options, like: inviting, resigning, member kicking and so on - this type of clans called <mark style="color:red;">unverified</mark>. &#x20;
